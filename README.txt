--- Aseprite Dark Grey Theme ----

WARNING: This version is exclusively for v1.2-beta8 and onwards of Aseprite.

You can find Aseprite at http://aseprite.org/ or http://store.steampowered.com/app/431730/. 
It's a cheap and fantastic tool for low resolution art and animation by David Capello, 
strongly recommended for pixel art game development.

What is this?
-------------------------------

This is a dark grey theme for Aseprite that I created by editing the original default skin made by David Capello and
Ilija Melentijevic, because I like dark grey themes.

How to Install
-------------------------------

Download the files from https://github.com/KashouC/darktheme

Copy the files into your theme folder. 
Start up Aseprite and go into Edit -> Preferences -> Theme, and click "Open Folder" to easily find the correct folder. 
(Be sure not to copy the files into the default folder, make a new one in the theme folder)

Then go back into the Theme window in Aseprite and click the theme and click Select. Restart Aseprite, and it should work.
If the theme doesn't show up, try restarting the program to allow it to load in.
