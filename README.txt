strongly recommended for pixel art game development.

What is this?
-------------------------------

This is a dark grey theme for Aseprite that I created by editing the original default skin 
made by David Capello and Ilija Melentijevic, because I like dark grey themes.

Colors based on the DarkFlat theme by michidk.
